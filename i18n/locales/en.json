      "paragraph1": "My name is Charles Robin. I worked as a private philosophy teacher for ten years. I created the YouTube channel Le Précepteur in 2018 to share my passion for philosophy.",
      "paragraph2": "When I started on YouTube, I never imagined that philosophy could generate so much public interest. YouTube is mainly a platform for entertainment, and if someone had told me one day that my videos on Plato, Spinoza, or Stoicism would be watched by millions of people, I wouldn’t have believed it.",
      "paragraph3": "It's quite paradoxical because, deep down, I’ve always believed that philosophy is a discipline open to everyone and meant for the greatest number. Very often, when people turn their backs on philosophy, it's mostly because of the way it is presented to them. Many associate it with pompous and useless rambling, without realizing that the questions philosophy raises are questions that concern them directly and that they ask themselves throughout their lives. And for that, it’s mainly the philosophers themselves who are to blame."

  "about_philosophy": {
    "title": "My Philosophy",
    "paragraphs": {
      "paragraph1": "My way of talking about philosophy goes against this conception. I believe that if what we say is not understood by the audience or does not spark their interest, the problem doesn't come from the audience, but from us.",
      "paragraph2": "I have always felt it necessary to put myself in the shoes of the person I am addressing, and to find the words that will make my message understandable. It’s this commitment to clarity and simplicity that I believe is at the root of my channel’s success.",
      "paragraph3": "When I see a comment from someone saying that I’ve helped them reconnect with philosophy, that’s the greatest reward for me. Because then, my work truly makes sense — that of being a mediator between great thinkers and the public, and of providing material for thought."
